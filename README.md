# Minesweeper!

## Minesweeper, an introduction
Since the dawn of time (well, since Windows 3.1 at least) peopple have been playing minesweeper...

**Goal of the Game**

In order to win, reveal all the safe squares on the board without exploding a mine. 

**How to Play**

Click on any unrevealed square to start the game. Numbers on the squares indicate the number of surrounding mines (this includes all 8 squares surrounding it in a 3×3 grid). Based on these numbers and how their 3×3 grids overlap, you can identify or suspect under which squares mines are hidden.

Place a flag by right clicking to mark it as dangerous. Reveal all safe squares without mines to win the game.

## Next Steps
Here's a list of the future feature I'd like to implement
- Beginner, intermediate, and advanced difficulties
- Timer with blurred background pause
- The numbers should change color based on how many mines are nearby
- Custom difficulty where you input the width, height, and number of mines
- Import and export of game state
- If it detects a mobile device, difficulty heights and widths are swapped
- Make it impossible to lose on the first click
- Update the graphics
